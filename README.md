# DiscreteProject_Spring2025

This project proposes potential bus route to allow travel and commute in between five colleges. I started with visualizing the maps of claremont colleges into networks of graph representation. Then I found potential hamiltonian path and euler paths to travel across campuses. There are two routes that I mainly focused on, and analyzed which route is better by counting the potential subsets of busiest locations on campus to model utility and demands. I was able to apply Combinatorics and graph theory to analyze transportation path planning and energy efficiency.
